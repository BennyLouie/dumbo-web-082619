# SWBAT
* Explain REST (Representational State Transfer)
  - Convention of naming files and paths
  - Template for the path + views
* Demonstrate how REST is used with CRUD
  - HTTP VERBS TRANSLATED TO CRUD:
    * GET - READ
    * POST - CREATE
    * PUT - UPDATE - Change an entire row
    * PATCH - UPDATE - Change a single column
    * DELETE - DELETE
* Build out CRUD using Sinatra
  - check out http://www.restular.com/

# RESTful CRUD
* Reading
* New
* Creating
  * Form
  * Mass assignment
* Edit form
  * Nested params
* Updating
  * One small caveat
* Deleting

## If we have time
* Build search
    * query string
    * params
    * filtering
    * forms
* Refactoring
  * helper methods
  * partials
